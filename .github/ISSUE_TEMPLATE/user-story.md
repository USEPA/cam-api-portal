## Testing
### Test Description
This description should detail what unit, feature, or function is being tested or what is being verified.

### Assumptions and Pre-Conditions
This entails any conditions to be met before test case execution. One example would be requiring a valid Outlook account for a login.

### Test Data
This relates to the variables and their values in the test case. In the example of an email login, it would be the username and password for the account.

### Steps to be Executed
These should be easily repeatable steps as executed from the end userâ€™s perspective. For instance, a test case for logging into an email server might include these steps:
